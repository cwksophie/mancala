        <h3>My Project</h3>
        <p>This is my Python Mancala project I made in coding class.  You can 
        download the game and try it out yorself!</p>

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>This version is a two player game of mancala so start by grabbing a 
        friend to play with you.  Choose who is going to go first.  Each player 
        makes a moving by choosing a space (1 through 6).  You can see the space
        numbers printed above or below the board in the terminal.  Once you 
        choose a space, the program will take all the stones stored in that 
        space and move around the board, dropping on stone in each space that it 
        passes.  If your last stone lands in your goal, you get another turn.  
        If your last stone lands in an empty space on your side and the other 
        player has stones in the space opposite, you get all those stones as well
        as your last stone added to your goal.</p>
        <h3>The Code</h3>
        <p>This project was pretty hard to make.  I had to make lots of different
        functions.  The psudocode for the project looked like this: </p>
            <pre>
Main Function:
    initialize board

    while game is not over:
        print board
        get player input
        make move and update board
        switch to next player
            </pre>
        <p>The first function I made was the <code>print_board()</code> 
        function.  I had to use string formatting to get the board to print out 
        nicely.  Next I wrote a function for getting the user input.  I used
        error handling to make sure that the user could only enter a number and 
        I also had to check if they choose a legitimate space.</p>
        <p>The hardest function to write was the update board function.  Figuring
        out how to move around the board took a lot of work and careful manipulation
        of list indecies.  I also had to take into account all the unusual cases
        like the last stone ending in a goal or an empty space.</p>
        <p>Once the update board function was done, the last function left was 
        just the function that checks whether or not the game is over.  A game 
        of Connect 4 ends when someone gets 4 in a row or the entire board is 
        full.  After completing that, all that was left was to put the whole 
        game together.</p>
